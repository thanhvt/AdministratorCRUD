## üåü About The Project

This project is a comprehensive boilerplate for building high-security, enterprise-grade financial applications. It leverages a monorepo architecture to ensure code reusability, maintainability, and a streamlined development workflow. The core is a Next.js application supported by a suite of shared packages for UI, services, and business logic.

## üìö Tech Stack

This project uses a modern and robust tech stack designed for performance and security:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 14 (with App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Monorepo**: [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) & [pnpm Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **UI Components**: [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) & [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
-   **Data Fetching & Caching**: [TanStack Query (React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
-   **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
-   **Form Management**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) & [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
-   **Data Tables**: [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest)
-   **Charting**: [Lightweight Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/lightweight-charts/)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The monorepo is structured to promote separation of concerns and maximize code sharing.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                    # Main Next.js application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                 # Shared ESLint, TypeScript configs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                     # Shared React components (Shadcn/UI)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/               # Shared business logic, API clients, hooks
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/                # Feature-specific packages
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ securities/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trading/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-settings/
```

-   **`apps/web`**: The main entry point for users. It consumes all other packages to build the final application.
-   **`packages/ui`**: A library of "dumb" UI components that can be used across any application in the monorepo.
-   **`packages/services`**: Contains all shared logic, such as authentication hooks, API client instances, and state management stores (Zustand).
-   **`packages/modules/*`**: Self-contained feature modules that bundle components, services, and types related to a specific business domain (e.g., trading).

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **High-Security Authentication**: Secure JWT (Access & Refresh) flow with `httpOnly` cookies.
-   **Modular Architecture**: Business logic is decoupled into independent modules (`Securities`, `Trading`, `User Settings`) for scalability.
-   **Shared Component Library**: A consistent look and feel across the application with a shared UI library from `packages/ui`.
-   **Advanced State Management**: Centralized state management with Zustand, integrated with React Query for server state.
-   **Dynamic User Experience**: Features like session timeout warnings, real-time market data simulation, and toast notifications.
-   **Developer-Friendly**: Optimized build system with Turborepo, shared configurations, and a streamlined setup process.

    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` in the `apps/web` directory and fill in the required values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

All scripts can be run from the root of the monorepo.

-   `pnpm dev`: Start all packages in development mode.
-   `pnpm build`: Build all packages for production.
-   `pnpm lint`: Lint all packages.
-   `pnpm type-check`: Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
-   `pnpm clean`: Remove all build artifacts and `node_modules`.

To run a script for a specific package, use the `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Run only the web application
pnpm --filter @banking/web dev

# Build only the UI package
pnpm --filter @banking/ui build
```
